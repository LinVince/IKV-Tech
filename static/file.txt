   'text':"The information architecture (IA) of their existing website didn't follow the principle of hierarchy. Every piece of information, regardless of its importance, was displayed plainly. They need a new website featuring a clear funnel-like IA because they wanted their customers to easily grasp what services or products IKV-Tech provided."},

  {'tag':'div','class':'text','text':"Generally, we follow Emphasize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test to create a new application. However, the challenge of the project lied in efficient content delivery because IKV-Tech's expertise was an extreme niche. People felt lost when browsing their website. As a result, I reorganized the design phases, Emphasize, Internalize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test."},

  {'tag':'div','class':'text','text':'1. Emphasize: I discovered their competitors put more emphasis on applications rather than expertise or know-how on their websites. Then I asked IKV-Tech to provide more information about applications so that customers could easily understand what they were doing.'},
  {'tag':'div','class':'text','text':'2. Internalize: To design the information architecture, there was a need to understand their expertise. I spent quite some time studying cryptography, key management, hardware security, cryptocurrency and cybersecurity-related papers.'},
  {'tag':'div','class':'text','text':'3. Define: I got down to the information architecture. First, I changed the term Product (on the original website) into Platform, onto which there were a wide range of applications to be built. By doing so, we expected to deliver a message that "customers bought a hardware platform on which they could facilitate their business" instead of "buying a hardware product the use of which was unknown.'},
  {'tag':'div','class':'text','text':'Second, I put more emphasis on the vertical applications IKV-Tech could fulfill by attaching related information to every product. With the information in sight, we expected an efficient communication about what IKV-Tech was doing.'},
  {'tag':'div','class':'text','text':'Finally, I defined the formats of information. For example, detailed product information would be presented as a brochure or whitepaper in PDF. Hardware specifications would be placed inside a drop-down text box for reference.'},
  {'tag':'div','class':'text','text':'4. Ideate: I sketched some wire frames to test out the appearance of information. Meanwhile, I downloaded high-quality photos for banners and illustrations. For whitepapers and brochures, I looked for enterprise-grade A4 templates and duplicated some of them through Adobe Illustrator.'},
   {'tag':'div','class':'text','text':'5. Prototype and Test: I arranged weekly meetings with C-level decision makers of IKV-Tech to test out the prototype until they were satisfied with the result.'}
